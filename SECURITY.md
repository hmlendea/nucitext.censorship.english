## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:

## 🧾 Safe Harbour

If your research is conducted in good faith, confined to authorised scope, and disclosed responsibly, the maintainers will not pursue action for policy-compliant activity.

## 🙏 Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Reporters who desire public attribution may be acknowledged in release notes, advisories, or a dedicated acknowledgements section.
